# 👋 Hi, I'm Van Nam

👀 Curious about many things — especially programming and how systems work  
🌱 Currently learning, breaking things, fixing them, and learning again  
💻 I enjoy building side projects, experimenting with ideas, and improving step by step  
🤖 Sometimes I code with the help of AI (because why not?)  
☕ Often thinking best at coffee shops

## 🧩 What You’ll Find Here

- Side projects and experiments  
- Backend ideas & system-related code  
- Some Unity / app experiments  
- Code written while learning, refactoring, or exploring new concepts  

Not everything here is perfect — but everything here is **part of the journey**.

## 🛠 Things I Like Working With

- Java, C#, JavaScript, SQL  
- Backend & system design concepts  
- Clean code, clear structure, and simple solutions  
- Turning “hmm…” into “ohhh, I get it now”

## 🌱 Currently Interested In

- Backend systems & architecture  
- How real systems behave in production  
- Logging, caching, and performance  
- Writing clearer code and explanations
