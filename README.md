# 👋 Hi, I'm Van Nam

👀 Curious about many things — especially programming and how systems work  
🌱 Currently learning, breaking things, fixing them, and learning again  
💻 I enjoy building side projects, experimenting with ideas, and improving step by step  
🤖 Sometimes I code with the help of AI (because why not?)

## 🛠 Things I Like Working With

- Java, C#, JavaScript, SQL  
- Backend & system design concepts
